 * exec_remote_cmd_loop(server_ip, port)
 *      server_ip:  a string in ip address format, indicating the servers IP
 *                  address.  Note 127.0.0.1 is the default meaning the server
 *                  is running on the same machine as the client
 *              
 *      port:   The port the server will use.  Note the constant 
 *              RDSH_DEF_PORT which is 1234 in rshlib.h.  If you are using
 *              tux you may need to change this to your own default, or even
 *              better use the command line override -c implemented in dsh_cli.c
 *              For example ./dsh -c 10.50.241.18:5678 where 5678 is the new port
 *              number and the server address is 10.50.241.18    
 * 
 *      This function basically implements the network version of 
 *      exec_local_cmd_loop() from the last assignment.  It will:
 *  
 *          1. Allocate buffers for sending and receiving data over the 
 *             network
 *          2. Create a network connection to the server, getting an active
 *             socket by calling the start_client(server_ip, port) function.
 *          2. Go into an infinite while(1) loop prompting the user for
 *             input commands. 
 * 
 *             a. Accept a command from the user via fgets()
 *             b. Send that command to the server using send() - it should
 *                be a null terminated string
 *             c. Go into a loop and receive client requests.  Note each
 *                receive might not be a C string so you need to print it
 *                out using:
 *                     printf("%.*s", (int)bytes_received, rsp_buff);
 *                this version of printf() uses the "%.*s" flag that indicates
 *                that the rsp_buff might be a null terminated string, or
 *                it might not be, if its not, print exactly bytes_received
 *                bytes. 
 *             d. In the recv() loop described above. Each time you receive
 *                data from the server, see if the last byte received is the
 *                EOF character. This indicates the server is done and you can
 *                send another command by going to the top of the loop.  The
 *                best way to do this is as follows assuming you are receiving
 *                data into a buffer called recv_buff, and you received
 *                recv_bytes in the call to recv:
 * 
 *                  recv_bytes = recv(sock, recv_buff, recv_buff_sz, 0)
 *                  
 *                if recv_bytes:
 *                  <negative_number>: communication error
 *                    0:    Didn't receive anything, likely server down
 *                  > 0:    Got some data. Check if the last byte is EOF
 *                          is_eof = (recv_buff[recv_bytes-1] == RDSH_EOF_CHAR) ? 1 : 0;
 *                    if is_eof is true, this is the last part of the transmission
 *                    from the server and you can break out of the recv() loop. 
 * 
 *   returns:
 *          OK:      The client executed all of its commands and is exiting
 *                   either by the `exit` command that terminates the client
 *                   or the `stop-server` command that terminates both the
 *                   client and the server. 
 *          ERR_MEMORY:             If this function cannot allocate memory via
 *                                  malloc for the send and receive buffers
 *          ERR_RDSH_CLIENT:        If the client cannot connect to the server. 
 *                                  AKA the call to start_client() fails.
 *          ERR_RDSH_COMMUNICATION: If there is a communication error, AKA
 *                                  any failures from send() or recv().
 * 
 *   NOTE:  Since there are several exit points and each exit point must
 *          call free() on the buffers allocated, close the socket, and
 *          return an appropriate error code.  Its suggested you use the
 *          helper function client_cleanup() for these purposes.  For example:
 * 
 *   return client_cleanup(cli_socket, request_buff, resp_buff, ERR_RDSH_COMMUNICATION);
 *   return client_cleanup(cli_socket, request_buff, resp_buff, OK);
 *
 *   The above will return ERR_RDSH_COMMUNICATION and OK respectively to the main()
 *   function after cleaning things up.  See the documentation for client_cleanup()
 *
